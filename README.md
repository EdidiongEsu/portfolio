Hello, my name is Edidiong Esu.

I am a passionate writer who is enthusiastic about getting information behind the obscurity of data. The idea that there is an infinite amount of information behind numbers keeps me ticking. I think my best attribute is the intentional effort to make sure i learn new things everyday. My hobbies include gaming, playing chess and playing basketball.

## My Projects
### [Similarity between Genres by analyzing 1.12Million words contained in blurbs using Natural Language Processing](https://github.com/EdidiongEsu/genre_NLP)
  I analyzed blurbs of over a million words to check for similarity between genres. A blurb is a short (usually about 200 words) description of a book  usually written for promotional purposes. I ascertained if blurbs are avid representations of whole books by checking for thee frequencies of words in each genre. Deductions were made which gave an insight into the writing style of african literature. The data used in this repository was scraped from Africa's most popular e-store by my [webcrawler](https://github.com/EdidiongEsu/okadabooks_scraper). Jaccard similarity was used to calculate the similarity metric by comparing word types across genres and the visulization was done with a donut plot.

 ### Scraping and analyzing of okadabooks
![](https://github.com/EdidiongEsu/portfolio/blob/master/img/double_header.PNG)
[Okadabooks](https://okadabooks.com/) is an online store of e-books dedicated to african literature. It is one of Africa's most largest platform with about 330,000 users and 500Milion pages read annually. 
The purpose of this project was to look into the reading patterns of  okadabooks readers from when it was founded in 2013. For self-publishing authors (Like myself), I generated a success metric for its authors and checked if there was a clear relationship between reads and the Price of each book.

The scraping of okadabooks involved combining the powerful libraries of selenium,request and BeautifulSoup. Selenium was used because of the dynamic content of the store. Scraping involved tapping LoadMore Pagination while ensuring to imitate user usage. More details on the webcrawler [here](https://github.com/EdidiongEsu/okadabooks_scraper).
