Hi, my name is Edidiong Esu.

I am a passionate writer who is enthusiastic about getting information behind the obscurity of data. The idea that there is an infinite amount of information behind numbers keeps me ticking. I think my best attribute is the intentional effort to make sure i learn new things everyday. My hobbies include gaming, playing chess and playing basketball.

## My Writing

![](https://github.com/EdidiongEsu/portfolio/blob/master/img/medium.PNG)
I write because i love to tell stories. For most projects, I make it a priority to put my findings in writing hoping to inspire or teach someone. I am an author for [Towards Data Science](https://towardsdatascience.com), the biggest data science publication in the world hosted on Medium. [Here](https://towardsdatascience.com/@eddy.esu.22) is my profile. Check [here](https://medium.com/@eddy.esu.22) to read more of my articles with great data insights.


## My Past Projects

### [Similarity between Genres by analyzing 1.12Million words contained in blurbs using Natural Language Processing](https://github.com/EdidiongEsu/genre_NLP)

</p>

I analyzed blurbs of over a million words to check for similarity between genres. A blurb is a short (usually about 200 words) description of a book written for promotional purposes. I ascertained if blurbs are accurate representations of whole books by checking for frequencies of words in each genre. Deductions were made which gave an insight into the writing style of african literature. The data used in this repository was scraped from Africa's most popular e-store by my [webcrawler](https://github.com/EdidiongEsu/okadabooks_scraper). 

[Jaccard similarity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaccard_index) was used to calculate the similarity metric by comparing word types across genres and the visulization was done with a donut plot.

 ### [Scraping and analyzing of okadabooks](https://github.com/EdidiongEsu/analyzing_okadabooks)
![](https://github.com/EdidiongEsu/portfolio/blob/master/img/double_header.PNG)
[Okadabooks](https://okadabooks.com/) is an online store of e-books dedicated to african literature. It is one of Africa's most largest platform with about 330,000 users and 500Milion pages read annually. 
The purpose of this project was to look into the reading patterns of  okadabooks readers from when it was founded in 2013. For self-publishing authors (Like myself), I generated a success metric for its authors and checked the frequency at which books were purchased from okadabooks.

The scraping of okadabooks involved combining the powerful libraries of selenium,request and BeautifulSoup. Selenium was used because of the dynamic content of the store. Scraping involved tapping LoadMore Pagination while ensuring to imitate user usage. More details on the webcrawler [here](https://github.com/EdidiongEsu/okadabooks_scraper).

</p>

This is mortality based analysis that focuses on the trend of child death from malaria in Nigeria and its neighbouring countries with respect to the whole world . Data was gotten from [UNICEF](https://data.unicef.org/). I looked into neonatal and post-neonatal deaths in a bid to see if the right steps had been taken into eliminating natal deaths. Comparisons were made with neighbouring countries and deductions were made respectively.

I wrote about my findings in an article on [medium](https://medium.com/@eddy.esu.22/global-reduction-in-infant-mortality-864d1879a217).

### [Analyzing IMDB Ratings of Movies across 100 years for different Work personalities](https://github.com/EdidiongEsu/Movie-Insights)
![](https://github.com/EdidiongEsu/Movie-Insights/blob/master/Pictures/Duration.jpeg)

In this project, I analyzed movies across a century to determine if [IMDB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IMDb) is a reliable platform to use when checking for ratings of movies. The insights were used to advise on the criterias to have in mind when selecting a movie to watch from a collection. It also looked into picking the best genres depending on what work schedules an individual has.

I wrote about my findings in an article on [medium](https://medium.com/@eddy.esu.22/deliberations-of-a-movie-buff-tips-to-aid-choosing-your-next-cinematic-experience-2fb001372be8).
