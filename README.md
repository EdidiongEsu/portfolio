Hello, my name is Edidiong Esu.

I am a passionate writer who is enthusiastic about getting information behind the obscurity of data. The idea that there is an infinite amount of information behind numbers keeps me ticking. I think my best attribute is the intentional effort to make sure i learn new things everyday. My hobbies include gaming, playing chess and playing basketball.

## My Projects
### Scraping and analyzing okadabooks

### [Similarity between Genres by analyzing blurbs using Natural Language Processing](https://github.com/EdidiongEsu/genre_NLP)
I analyzed blurbs of over a million words to check for similarity between genres. A blurb is a short (usually about 200 words) description of a book  usually written for promotional purposes. I ascertained if blurbs are avid representations of whole books. Deductions were made from this analysis which corelated with my initial assumptions. The data used in this repository was scraped from Africa's most popular e-store by my [webcrawler](https://github.com/EdidiongEsu/okadabooks_scraper). I choose 4 categories out of the 22 categories in my data.  Jaccard similarity was used to calculate the similarity metric by comparing word types across genres and the visulization was done with a donut plot.
