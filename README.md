Hello, my name is Edidiong Esu.

I am a passionate writer who is enthusiastic about getting information behind the obscurity of data. The idea that there is an infinite amount of information behind numbers keeps me ticking. I think my best attribute is the intentional effort to make sure i learn new things everyday. My hobbies include gaming, playing chess and playing basketball.

## My Projects
### Scraping and analyzing okadabooks


### [Similarity between Genres by analyzing blurbs using Natural Language Processing](https://github.com/EdidiongEsu/genre_NLP)
I analyzed blurbs of over a million words to check for similarity between genres. I ascertained if blurbs are avid representation of whole books by tokenizing all blurbs to check for most common words in all genres. Deductions were made from this analysis which corelated with my initial assumptions. I choose 4 categories out of the 22 categories in my data. This data was scraped from Africa's most popular e-store by my [webcrawler](https://github.com/EdidiongEsu/okadabooks_scraper). Jaccard similarity was used to calculate the similarity metric by comparing word types across genres and the visulization was done with a donut plot.
